1. Normal Statements
---> these are general-purpose statements in a programming language.They may or may not perform an actual execution step.       example -- import statements(import math),declaration(int n)

2.Executable statements
---> these are the statements that are actually executed at runtime.They perform some operation or action(computation,input/output,assignment,function,call,control flow,etc.)      example -- loops,conditionals,function calls
